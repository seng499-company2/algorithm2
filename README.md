# Algorithm 2: Class Offering Capacity Forecaster

This repository contains a small package, *Class-Capacity-Forecaster*, for
estimating required course offering capacities based on historical enrollment
data. 

This package was authored for the Company 2 course scheduler project by the Company2-Algorithm2 subsystem team.

## Setup

Clone this repo into the scheduler (or backend) repository. Inside the algorithm 2 module directory,
build and install the package as follows:

```bash
$ python3 -m build
$ pip3 install ./dist/Class-Capacity-Forecaster-0.0.1.tar
```

The algorithm 2 module may then be imported into and called from the backend.

```python
import Class-Capacity-Forecaster
```
